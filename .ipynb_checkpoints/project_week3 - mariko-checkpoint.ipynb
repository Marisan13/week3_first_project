Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\\nDrop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.\\nRemove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil.

(See note in About section on where to purchase)\\nFirst boil your eggs, then slide the egg inside the press and screw the top down so it pushes the egg into the corners.\\nLet the egg cool and remove it from the mold. For better results use medium size eggs.\\nIf you intend to prepare this for a party, I suggest you buy several cubers, this way you can boil and chill several eggs at a time, or it will take you a lot of time.\\nTo prepare hard boiled eggs, place eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as the water comes to a full boil, let the eggs boil for 5 minutes, and then remove from heat and let stand covered in hot water 10 minutes .\\nFilling is made with cream cheese, ham and egg yolk, it tastes very soft, it is ideal for kids.  \n",

       "3  Hard boil your eggs.  To get perfectly hard boiled eggs, once the water is boiling, add your eggs and set your timer for 9 12 minutes.  As soon as your timer goes off, remove the eggs and put them in a bath of cold water.\\nOnce your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs.\\nNow you'll want to take about a 14 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg.\\nTake the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg.\\nRoll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated.\\nThe final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\\nDrop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.\\nRemove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil. Cut the eggs in half or quarters and serve while hot.  \n",

Set aside.\\nCrack and beat an egg on a plate. On a separate plate  add breadcrumbs.\\nDip agnolotti in the beaten egg first.\\nThen coat it with breadcrumbs.  Repeat step 5 and 6 with the remaining agnolotti until egg and breadcrumbs are finished.\\nPlace the crumbed agnolotti onto a baking tray. Once youve completed step 5 and 6, spray another thin layer of oil over the crumbed aganolotti. Bake the crumbed agnolotti for 25 minutes or until golden brown.\\nServe immediately with pasta sauce or ketchup.  \n",
