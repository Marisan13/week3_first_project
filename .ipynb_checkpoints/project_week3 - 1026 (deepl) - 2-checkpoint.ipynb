Knead it at least for 10 minutes, until the dough becomes very elastic and smooth, and it no longer sticks to your hands. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes, dusted with flour and wrapped in a kitchen towel.Roll out the dough with a rolling pin or with the pasta machine to make long and paper thin sheets of pasta, about 1 or 2 mm thick, so that the cenci will be feather light when fried. Use a tiny amount of flour to help rolling out the dough, but try to dust it off or shake it off from the cenci, because it will be the first thing to burn in the hot frying oil, giving an unpleasant burnt flour taste to our cenci.Cut the pasta sheets with a knife or a wheel in strips about a span long and 3 inches in width.Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet and when it reaches 180°C deep fry the cenci. If you don't have a cooking thermometer, use some dough scraps to check when the oil is ready: it will be hot enough when, dipping a thin scrap, this will be immediately surrounded by many tiny bubbles.Fry the cenci in batches for about 30 seconds per side, checking them often and turning them with two forks or a pair of pliers.Carefully remove the cenci from the oil and drain them for a few minutes on a dish lined with kitchen paper, then dust them with caster sugar or powdered sugar. They are delicious warm, but, believe me, you will recognize all the flavours and aromas just when cold!</td>\n",

Pour into the prepared tin, place on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 35-40 mins or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool for 5 mins before carefully turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.\\nTo make the glaze, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally. Once the chocolate has melted, pour in the blood orange juice and stir to combine. Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool, then chill until the glaze is thick but still pourable. Once the glaze is at the desired consistency, pour over the cake, allowing it to drip down the sides. Sprinkle the orange zest over to finish.

Grease and flour a 6 inch Bundt pan or a 9 inch round cake pan.Cut the ends off the orange and then cut it into quarters. Put quarters in a food processor and grind into a pulp. Set aside.In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar. Add the olive oil and whisk until blended, then whisk in the orange pulp. Next, stir in the salt and baking powder, making sure the baking powder is evenly distributed and doesnt clump, then add the 2 cups of flour and stir until blended.Pour batter into pan and bake at 350 for 35 minutes or until a pick inserted comes out clean. Allow cake to cool for about 10 minutes in the pan, then carefully invert. Let cool, then dust cake with powdered sugar and serve with sweetened whipped cream and fruit.  \n",
       "2  Pour the flour onto a wooden pastry board or on a large working surface, make a well in the centre and put all the other ingredients there.Knead all the ingredients with your hands, as if to make homemade pasta. Knead it at least for 10 minutes, until the dough becomes very elastic and smooth, and it no longer sticks to your hands. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes, dusted with flour and wrapped in a kitchen towel.Roll out the dough with a rolling pin or with the pasta machine to make long and paper thin sheets of pasta, about 1 or 2 mm thick, so that the cenci will be feather light when fried. Use a tiny amount of flour to help rolling out the dough, but try to dust it off or shake it off from the cenci, because it will be the first thing to burn in the hot frying oil, giving an unpleasant burnt flour taste to our cenci.Cut the pasta sheets with a knife or a wheel in strips about a span long and 3 inches in width.Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet and when it reaches 180°C deep fry the cenci. If you don't have a cooking thermometer, use some dough scraps to check when the oil is ready: it will be hot enough when, dipping a thin scrap, this will be immediately surrounded by many tiny bubbles.Fry the cenci in batches for about 30 seconds per side, checking them often and turning them with two forks or a pair of pliers.Carefully remove the cenci from the oil and drain them for a few minutes on a dish lined with kitchen paper, then dust them with caster sugar or powdered sugar. They are delicious warm, but, believe me, you will recognize all the flavours and aromas just when cold!  \n",

Have a 9x9 pan ready.In a large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until light and creamy. Gradually beat in the flour and salt. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan. Bake for 20 minutes or until lightly golden. Set aside to cool. If you don’t let the crust cool, the filling will melt into it.Whisk the sugar and eggs until blended, then add juice, zest, and flour. Return to the oven and bake 30-35 minutes or until set. Allow to cool. Before serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar.  \n",

With the mixer on medium-low speed, pour in the juice and oil, mixing until fully combined. Sieve the flour into the bowl and whisk until just combined to a smooth batter. Pour into the prepared tin, place on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 35-40 mins or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool for 5 mins before carefully turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.\\nTo make the glaze, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally. Once the chocolate has melted, pour in the blood orange juice and stir to combine. Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool, then chill until the glaze is thick but still pourable. Once the glaze is at the desired consistency, pour over the cake, allowing it to drip down the sides. Sprinkle the orange zest over to finish. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days; can be frozen for up to 3 months.  \n",

Heat an oven proof skillet on the stove at a medium heat and melt the butter in the skillet, swirling it to coat the bottom and sides of the pan. The butter should simmer in the pan slightly.In a bowl, whisk together all of the Dutch Baby ingredients until smooth. Pour the batter into the heated skillet and then place into the oven to bake. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Remove from oven.For Fruit Topping:While the dutch baby is baking, toss the strawberries, oranges and sugar together in a bowl. Serve over warm dutch baby.  "
